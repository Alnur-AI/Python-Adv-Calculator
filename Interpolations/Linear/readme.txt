This program performs linear interpolation on an uneven grid

Run the program with the following command: python3 task3.1.py


test.ans - output data on the Y axis (formed by the linear interpolation formula)
test.dat - output data on the X axis (a new linear interpolation is formed from this data)
train.ans - input data on the Y axis (we build linear interpolation from them)
train.dat - input data on the X axis (we build linear interpolation from them)
