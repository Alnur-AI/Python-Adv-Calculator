This program performs spline interpolation on a uniform grid

Run the program with the following command: python3 task3.3.py


test.ans - output data on the Y axis (formed by the formula of spline interpolation)
test.dat - output data on the X axis (a new interpolation is formed from this data)
train.ans - input data along the Y axis (we build interpolation from them)
train.dat - input data on the X axis (we build interpolation from them)
